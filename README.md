Hi, I’m Suaksh — a passionate programmer who loves turning coffee ☕ and code 💻 into real-world solutions.

🔧 I build with Python, JavaScript, Java, C#, HTML/CSS, and I’m always exploring new stacks and tools.
🛠️ From backend logic to pixel-perfect frontends, I enjoy crafting clean, maintainable, and efficient code.
🔐 I have a growing interest in cybersecurity, and I’m always learning how to build safer systems.
🗂️ Databases, APIs, debugging, automation — bring it on!

When I’m not coding, I’m probably refactoring my to-do list or teaching myself something new just for the fun of it.
